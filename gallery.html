            <div class="image-description"><a href="">Shri Ram Mandir, popularly known as Ram Mandir, is a Hindu temple located in Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh. As the name suggests, the temple is dedicated to Lord Shri Rama and is believed to have been built at Ram Janmabhoomi (the birthplace of Lord Shri Rama).</a></div>

            <div class="image-description"><a href="">The Ram Mandir is a Hindu temple under construction in Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh, at the site of Ram Janmabhoomi, the presumed birthplace of Lord Rama. The construction follows a Supreme Court verdict in 2019, allocating the disputed land to Hindus for the temple and providing Muslims with an alternative site for a mosque.</a></div>

            <div class="image-description"><a href="">The temple's construction began with a groundbreaking ceremony in 2020, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The design, originally created in 1988 by the Sompura family, underwent modifications in 2020. Once complete, the temple is expected to be the world's third-largest Hindu temple, featuring a unique architectural style and various mandapas.</a></div>

            <div class="image-description"><a href="">The temple project has faced controversies, including allegations of donation misuse, sidelining activists, and politicization by the BJP. The Babri Masjid, previously on the site, was demolished in 1992, leading to inter-communal violence. The political and religious aspects of the issue have been significant.</a></div>

            <div class="image-description"><a href="">Kanak Bhawan is to the north-east of Ram Janam Bhumi, Ramkot, in Ayodhya. Kanak Bhawan is one of the finest and famous temples in Ayodhya and is a must visit.</a></div>
        </div>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="gallery/kanakbhawan2.webp" alt="image">
            <div class="image-description"><a href="">It is believed that this Bhawan was gifted to Devi Sita by Kaikei immediately after her marriage to Lord Ram. This is private palace of Devi Sita and Lord Rama.</a></div>

            <div class="image-description"><a href="">
            Over the centuries, Kanak Bhawan underwent several renovations and restorations. King Vikramaditya played a pivotal role in preserving this sacred site during his reign. But the way the temple looks now is mostly because of Vrish Bhanu Kunwari. She is the Queen of Teekamgarh in Madhya Pradesh. Her dedication to the preservation of this temple ensures that Kanak Bhawan stands proudly even today.</a></div>

            <div class="image-description"><a href="">Stepping inside Kanak Bhawan is like entering a realm of divine beauty. The main idols installed in the garbhgrih (sanctum) are none other than Lord Rama and Devi Sita, adorned with golden crowns that shimmer in the soft, incandescent light.

            <div class="image-description"><a href="">Kanak Bhawan is also famous as the Sone-ka-Mandir, which translates to the Temple of Gold. This name is fitting because of the golden crowns on the idols inside. The inner part of the temple is protected by a shiny silver roof, which makes the temple look even more rich and attractive.</a></div>
